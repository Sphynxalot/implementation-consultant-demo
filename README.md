# Implementation Consultant Demo

This project simulates the type of tasks an Implementation Consultant might perform during a post-deployment audit for a client's quality management system. Built in MySQL Workbench, it covers schema design, realistic sample data, and practical SQL audit queries.

---

## ðŸ§© Schema Overview

The database consists of the following core tables:

- **Users**: Client employees using the system.
- **Modules**: Software modules that have been deployed to the client.
- **Permissions**: Tracks module access granted to users.
- **AuditLogs**: Records system activity (logins, actions, attempts).
- **Issues**: Tracks compliance or usage-related issues raised by users.

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Data

The seed dataset simulates real usage from a mid-sized client organization:

- 6 users across Quality, IT, and Compliance departments.
- 5 modules, some fully deployed, others inactive.
- Audit logs for logins, usage, and failed access attempts.
- Compliance issues including bugs, access violations, and training needs.

## ðŸ“Š Audit Queries & Use Cases

Here are examples of audit checks an Implementation Consultant might run:

| Use Case | Query |
|----------|-------|
| **Access audit** | Users with access to 'Document Control' |
| **Engagement check** | Users who havenâ€™t logged in for 30 days |
| **Security audit** | Users who attempted access but were denied |
| **Compliance status** | List of unresolved user issues |
| **Module usage** | Most active modules by interaction count |
| **Login analysis** | Peak login times and 30-day login trends |

All queries are available in [`audit_queries.sql`](./audit_queries.sql).

## ðŸ”§ Technology Stack

- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (Joins, Aggregates, Subqueries, Date Functions)
- Data modeling with foreign key relationships

---

## ðŸ§  Motivation

This project demonstrates how data insights can support deployment success, highlight compliance concerns, and improve client satisfaction â€” core to the implementation role.
